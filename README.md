## Evaluantion

- Call by value
"In call by value, the argument expression is evaluated, and the resulting value is bound to the corresponding variable in the function " (Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_value]
- Call by name
"Call by name is an evaluation strategy where the arguments to a function are not evaluated before the function is called" (Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_name]
